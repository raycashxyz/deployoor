Harden deployment records and test helpers: records now carry `schemaVersion: 1`, use chain-id-based filesystem keys, guard chainId mismatches on reuse, warn on stale bytecode/constructor args, and write filesystem records atomically under a lock. `@deployoor/testing` now exposes tevm, cheatcodes, fixtures, and deployment-record seeding (seeded records are remapped onto the in-memory chain so `getOrDeploy` reuses them). Verifier plugins can retry reused deployments when artifact metadata is available, Slack can notify failed deploys, and the wagmi plugin uses Zod 4-safe validators with ABI drift checks.

**BREAKING (pre-1.0):** the record folder layout changed from `deployments/<chain name>/` to `deployments/<chainId>-<slug>/` (e.g. `deployments/sepolia/` → `deployments/11155111-sepolia/`), and the record's `networkName` field now holds that composite key. Records written by 0.1.x are not read from the old location — move each folder to its new name (and update `networkName` inside the files, or let the next deploy rewrite them) before re-running deploy scripts, or `getOrDeploy` will redeploy.
